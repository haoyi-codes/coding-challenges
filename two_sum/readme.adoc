== Discription

Given an array of integers called *nums* and an integer *target* return the
indices of two numbers in the array that add up to the target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you shouldn't
use the same element twice.

This has been adapted from https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum.

=== Test case 1

nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9

The code should return [0,1]

=== Test case 2

nums = [3,2,4], target = 6

The code should return [1,2]

=== Test case 3

nums = [3,3], target = 6

The code should return [0,1]
